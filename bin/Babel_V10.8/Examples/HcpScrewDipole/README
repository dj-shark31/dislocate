Screw dislocation dipole with Burgers vector b = a/3 [2 -1 -1 0] in hcp Zr.
gliding in a prismatic plane

Parameters are the one of EAM #3 Mendelev Ackland potential
	a = 3.234 Ã…
	c/a = 1.598

1) Directory 1_Rotation: 

Rotate elastic constants to obtain their values in the axis
	ex // [0 0 0 1]	      : glide direction
	ey // [0 1 -1 0]      : normal to glide plane
	ez // 1/3 [2 -1 -1 0] : Burgers vector and dislocation line

and also Zr hcp unit cell

2) Directory 2_Duplicate

Create supercell for perfect hcp lattice in correct orientation
	20 times along x
	24 times along y
	10 times along z

3) Directory 3_Dislo

Create dislocation dipole
first dislocation is located in 
    x1 = (10 + 1/4)*|ez| = 10.25*1.598 = 16.3795
    y1 = (6 + 1/3)*|ey| = 10.96965511460288952562
and second dislocation
    x1 = x2 = 16.3795
    y1 = (18 + 1/3)*|ey| = 31.75426480542941704786
