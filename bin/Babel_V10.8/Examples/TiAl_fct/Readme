-------------------------------
Step 1: rotation of the crystal
------

Tetragronal lattice with 
c/a = 4.076/3.999 = 1.019

We want to have in new reference frame:
 - Burgers vector: b = 0.5 [ 1 1 0 ] along ez 
 - glide direction: g = [-1 1 2 ] along ex 

The corresponding rotation matrix is calculated in 'rotation.gnu' gnuplot script file
command: gnuplot rotation.gnu

The L10 structure and the corresponding elastic constants are rotated with 'input_rotate.babel' file
command: babel input_rotate.babel | tee output_rotate.babel



-------------------------------
Step 2: replicate the crystal
	n1 times along U1
	n2 times along U2

Dimensions of the periodicity cells: 
l1 ~ 1.225a
l2 ~ 1.732a
To have an almost square simulation box, we should have n2 ~ 0.707 n1
To have a quadrupolar arrangement with both dislocations in exactly the same 
configuration, both n1 and n2 should be even
If n1 is odd, one dislocation will be in-between a pair of Al atoms 
and the other in a pair of Ti atoms.
If n2 is odd, a shift by n2/2*U2 is not possible for the second dislocation

	n1=6	n2=4	144 atoms
	n1=8	n2=6	288 atoms	=> we choose these values


-------------------------------
Step 3: create the dislocation dipole

* case 1: dislocations centered in-between two Al atoms
Positions of the dislocations:
	dislo1: 2 U1 + 3/2 U2
	dislo2: 6 U1 + 9/2 U2
Cartesian coordinates calculated with gnuplot script 'position_dislo1.gnu'
command: gnuplot position_dislo1.gnu
Dislocation dipole created with 'input_dilso1.babel' file
command: babel input_dislo1.babel | tee output_dislo1.babel

* case 2: dislocations centered in-between two Ti atoms
Positions of the dislocations:
	dislo1:  5/2 U1 + 3/2 U2
	dislo2: 13/2 U1 + 9/2 U2
Cartesian coordinates calculated with gnuplot script 'position_dislo2.gnu'
command: gnuplot position_dislo2.gnu
Dislocation dipole created with 'input_dilso2.babel' file
command: babel input_dislo2.babel | tee output_dislo2.babel
