1) Build file "hcp_all.pattern" by running in directory 1_PatternDetect the commands
	patternDetect input_hcp.patternDetect
	patternDetect input_twinned.patternDetect
	patternDetect input_twinned2.patternDetect
	patternDetect input_prism_fault.patternDetect

Concatenate all obtained *.pattern files in a single file containing all relevant crystallographic patterns.
For the prism fault, we only keep the two patterns with 13 neighbours corresponding to the two fault planes.
We obtain a total of 8 different patterns stored in the file hcp_all.pattern


2) Calculate Burgers density on each atom by running the command
	displacement input_screw.displacement


3) Interpolate Burgers density with Fourier series using the command
	fourierFit2D < input_screw.fourierFit2D
and plot the result with
	gnuplot burgers_density.gnu

Burgers density can be superposed to Vitek map
	gnuplot vitek_screw.gnu
