	by adding some noise on Cij, the noisy matrix being definite positive.

	=> clipAtom for program displacement

V4.8	=> You can compile your own Blas and Lapack libraries 
	=> The program check that vectors A and L as defined by Stroh are linearly independant.
	   If not, it would stop and propose you to add some noise to the elastic constants 
	   so as to break symmetry.

	=> uTranslate(1:3) is multiplied by alat

		ex: cat input.dat | babel -

	   (not when line-forces are present)

	=> optimization of subroutine strain.f90 (stress calculated only if required)

	   interaction with image dislocations and with homogeneous strain (same result as in V4.0)
	=> homogeneous strain due to line-force couples corrected
	=> new program: displacement
V4.0 (September 2007):
	=> elastic energy is computed for dislocations (not when line-forces or line-force couples are present)

V3.3:	=> homogeneous strain can be applied
	=> xyz format allows alloy (only pure elements for cfg formats)
	=> cutting half-plane is defined by cutDislo and cutLineForce 
	(nDislo and nLineForce become obsolete)

To Do:
=====
	-> création de la table des voisins par la méthode des cellules

	-> vérifier que les distributions de lignes de forces sont équilibrées dans le cas des conditions aux limites périodiques.
	-> clipAtom uniquement suivant x, y ou z
	-> vérifier les rotations des dislocations
	-> séparer les différents programmes
